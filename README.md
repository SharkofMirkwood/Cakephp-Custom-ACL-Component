Cakephp-Custom-ACL-Component
============================

My custom ACL component for ACL. I found Cake's built-in ACL functionality quite annoying to use and thought I'd make a more simplified version.


### Requirements

* CakePHP 2.3.X (anything above 2.0.x will probably work, but is untested)

### Installation

1. Copy CustomAclComponent.php to app/Controller/Component
2. Use the sql file to create the tables (or do this manually). Users table is included but you more than likely already have this set up.


### Notes
